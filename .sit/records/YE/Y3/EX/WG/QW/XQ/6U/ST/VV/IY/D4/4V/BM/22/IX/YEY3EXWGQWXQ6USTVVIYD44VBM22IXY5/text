Tuple implies ordering of its elements, while in SIT there is no
particular ordering of elements in records (other than for
identification purposes -- and this is something that can and will
become more flexible in the future)

Solution: rename "tuple" to "ensemble"

Also, this renames POSTER/1 to SPORE/1, which (I think) is a much better
name because of its reference to desert computing as in "A
dormant nonreproductive body formed by certain bacteria in response to
adverse environmental conditions."
